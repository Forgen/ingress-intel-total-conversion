I asked if IITC was okay and well, the answer is no.

Stefan,

Thank you for contacting us.  We appreciate your enthusiasm in sharing
Ingress information. Unfortunately, Ingress Intel Total Conversion all
IITC plugins, and your mobile Ingress Intel app are in violation of our
Terms of Service <http://ingress.com/terms>.

We would greatly appreciate it if you remove all works, and refrain from
creating any future works using Ingress content.

Please reply to this email when the works in question have been deleted.

Regards,

Lenette

I just found out they have an official forum. I guess posting there is
better than contacting them via mail. Even if you don’t agree with Niantic
# BE NICE
and don’t spam. Here’s the link to the thread:
